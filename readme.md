# React Shop ðŸ›’
This project is part of a courses series where we build an online shop with Stack PERNN (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React.js, Node.js and Next.js).
[In the first level of this project](https://github.com/Elchicogamer117/YardSaleShop), we made the layout of e-shop, 
now we transform that code in components and add important interactions.

Among the main functionalities achieved to this point are:
- Integration with api to display a wide variety of articles
- Display the menu in both the mobile and desktop versions
- Add and remove items from cart
- Show the sum total of your products

All this taking advantage of the main features of react(State, Context, Custom Hooks, etc.)
Additionally, full integration with webpack and babel was achieved to ensure the project could run in any browser and was ready for deployment.
